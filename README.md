# MyMovieTheaterApp

This web application serves the purpose of a regular online movie theater website, where a customer can view what movies the theater offers,
view what times a specific movie is being played, and buy tickets for a specific seats for a movie ahead of time. The application also allows users with
admin permission to add movies and viewings to the site.

This web application was built using the ASP.NET MVC 5 framework. It uses Entity Framework and code first migrations for the database. The controllers, WebApis,
and Models are programmed using C#, while the views are programmed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All the datatables present in the application were made using
the AJAX Datatable plug-in.

Ultimately, I started this project as a way to learn more about web development and I learned a significant amount about web APIs, routing, AJAX, using HTML and
JavaScript together, and about the MVC framework specifically.
